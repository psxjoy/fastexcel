Please make sure you are subscribed to the mailing list you are posting to!

If you are not subscribed to the mailing list, your message will either be rejected or you won't receive the response.

### How to subscribe to a mailing list

Before you can post a message to a mailing list, you need to subscribe to the list first.

1. Send an email without any contents or subject to `listname-subscribe@fesod.apache.org`. (replace listname with dev or commits)
2. Wait till you receive an email with the subject `confirm subscribe to listname@fesod.apache.org`. Reply to that email, without editing the subject or including any contents.
3. Wait till you receive an email with the subject `WELCOME to listname@fesod.apache.org`.

If you email us with a code snippet, make sure that:

* you do not link to files in external services as such files can change, get deleted or the link might break and thus make an archived email thread useless
* you paste text instead of screenshots of text
* you keep formatting when pasting code to keep the code readable
* there are enough import statements to avoid ambiguities

### Post Plain Text Mails

When posting to the mailing lists, please use plain text emails. **Do not use HTML emails**. HTML emails are more likely to be targeted as spam mails and rejected. It may get malformed through different mail clients and not easily readable by others.

## Issues

All issues will be tracked and handled through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apache/fesod/issues).
