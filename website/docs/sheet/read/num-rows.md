# Reading Rows

This chapter introduces how to read a specified number of rows.

## Overview

During data analysis and processing, quickly viewing the first few rows of a spreadsheet file can help us better
understand the data structure and content.
By default, Fesod reads all data from the entire spreadsheet file.
However, by setting the `numRows` parameter, you can limit the number of rows to read. 0 means no limit on the number of
rows, i.e., read all rows. The row count includes header rows.

## All Sheets

### Code Example

```java
@Test
public void allSheetRead() {
    // Read the first 100 rows
    FesodSheet.read(fileName, DemoData.class, new PageReadListener<DemoData>(dataList -> {
        for (DemoData demoData : dataList) {
            log.info("Read one record: {}", JSON.toJSONString(demoData));
        }
    })).numRows(100).sheet().doRead();
}
```

## Single Sheet

### Code Example

```java
@Test
public void singleSheetRead() {
    try (ExcelReader excelReader = FesodSheet.read(fileName, DemoData.class, new DemoDataListener()).build()) {
        ReadSheet readSheet = FesodSheet.readSheet(0).build();
        readSheet.setNumRows(100); // Read the first 100 rows
        excelReader.read(readSheet);
    }
}
```
