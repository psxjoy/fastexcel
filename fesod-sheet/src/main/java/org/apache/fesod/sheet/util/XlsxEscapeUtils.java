 * The {@code _xHHHH_} escapes that xlsx uses for characters XML 1.0 forbids, defined by section 3.18.9 of the Office
 * Open XML spec.
 * <p>
 * Every xlsx read path decodes them, whichever part carries the text:
 * {@link org.apache.fesod.sheet.analysis.v07.handlers.sax.SharedStringsTableHandler SharedStringsTableHandler} for
 * {@code sharedStrings.xml}, and
 * {@link org.apache.fesod.sheet.analysis.v07.handlers.CellTagHandler CellTagHandler} for an inline or direct string
 * held by the cell itself. POI decodes on both of its own read paths, the DOM {@code XSSFCell} and the streaming
 * {@code XSSFSheetXMLHandler}.
 * <p>
 * The convention escapes itself: text that is literally {@code _x0041_} is stored as {@code _x005F_x0041_}, since
 * {@code _x005F_} is the escape for the underscore. Decoding it yields the literal back, not {@code A}.
 * <p>
 * The write half of the same convention lives in
 * {@link EscapeHexCellWriteHandler EscapeHexCellWriteHandler}, which produces
 * that {@code _x005F_x} form. Both sides read {@code _xHHHH_} the same way, so a change to what counts as an escape
 * belongs in both.
